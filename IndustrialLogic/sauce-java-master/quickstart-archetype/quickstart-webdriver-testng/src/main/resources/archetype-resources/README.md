This project contains sample source code that demonstrates how to construct a TestNG test to run a
WebDriver instance against Sauce OnDemand.

It contains two classes, WebDriverTest.java, which is a pure-WebDriver test, and WebDriverWithHelperTest.java,
which demonstrates how to integrate the Sauce TestNG Helper classes.

The tests can be run by executing

    mvn package
